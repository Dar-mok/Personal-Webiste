    <p class="about">
      I started working for myself early in life. As a child I ran a pretty successful lawn
      care business. At age 18 I continued working for myself, doing restoration and renovation work
      on residential homes and small businesses. While I found some success with this work, I have found
      myself wanting change, something different. I've read about many succesfull people who have had multiple
      carreers throughout their lives, and it motivated me to seek something new for myself. In comes coding.
      With writing/learning to write code, I can bring in that same can-do attitude mixed with an entrepeneurs
      work ethic and my experience of teaching myself off the internet. Making a plan, figuring out how to do it,
      then making it happen. I'm good at that type of thing.
